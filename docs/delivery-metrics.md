#### Our recommendation is to collect the following metrics for team effectiveness & productivity. 

**Delivery Metrics (Product & Squad level)**

1. Lead Time - Tracks the time it takes for a code change to go from commit (branch or main) to production 
2. Deployment Frequency - Measures how often code is deployed 
3. Change Failure Rate* - Percentage of changes that result in failures after it is in production or released to end user
4. Minutes of Impact - Calculates the down time from a service disruption over set time

**Engineering Metrics (Squad level)**

5. Branch & PR Age - Evaluates development best practices on repos
6. Code Coverage - Provides percent of unit testing covering the lines of code
7. Code Quality - Assesses high or low quality of code as well as security related defects

**Joy Index (all level)**

8. Team & Leadership Joy Index - Benchmarks individual developer experience, satisfaction, and happiness

**Product Metrics (Product level)**

9. Business OKRs defined & measurable - Verify the squads have established high quality OKRs with clearly defined measures

# Why Metrics Matter 


### Quantifiable Performance 



* Metrics provide objective measurements of squad performance, fostering a data-driven culture. They enable squads to track progress, set benchmarks, and identify areas for improvement. 


### Continuous Improvement 



* By identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies, metrics drive continuous improvement efforts. Squads can refine processes, optimize workflows, and enhance collaboration to accelerate delivery. 


### Risk Mitigation 



* Lower change failure rates and shorter Minutes of Impact indicate increased software stability and reliability. This minimizes business risks associated with service disruptions and costly downtimes. 


### Informed Decision-Making 



* Metrics facilitate informed decision-making by offering a comprehensive view of the software delivery pipeline. Squads can make strategic choices to align with business goals. 


### Cross-Functional Collaboration 



* These metrics encourage collaboration between development, operations, and quality assurance teams. Silos are broken down, fostering a holistic approach to software delivery. 

Software powers innovation and competitive advantage and metrics have emerged as the compass guiding software delivery squads toward success. They provide a roadmap to accelerated delivery, enhanced quality, and collaborative excellence. By leveraging the insights gleaned from these metrics, organizations can transform their software delivery processes and stay at the forefront of their industries.


# 


# Delivery Metrics  (Product & Squad level)


## Lead Time 

Measures the time it takes for a code change to go from commit (branch or main) to production. Provides insights into workflow efficiency and bottlenecks. Shorter lead times indicate smoother processes and quicker value delivery. 



* _How to measure:_ Conduct squad level VSM to gather time code change goes from commit to production
* _Example: _Squad’s lead time is 509.15h (~64 days). Working time is 163.85h (~20 days)


## Deploy Frequency 

Measures how often code is deployed. Enables rapid iteration and faster time-to-market. Encourages small, incremental changes, reducing the risk of failures. 



* _How to measure:_ Divide the total number of deployments made in a given time period (e.g., a month) by the total number of days in that period
* _Example:_ If a squad deployed code 10 times in a month with 31 days, the deployment frequency would be 10/31 = 0.32 deployments per day


## Change Failure Rate 

Gauges the percentage of deployments that result in failures. Offers visibility into code quality and stability. Low failure rates signify robust testing and higher software reliability. 



* _How to measure:_ Percentage of changes that were made to code that then resulted in incident/rollback/or any type of prod failure. Calculated by counting the number of deployment failures and then dividing by number of total deployments.
* _Example:_ If your squad deployed five times this week and one of them resulted in a failure, your change failure rate is 20%


## Minutes of Impact (MoI)

Calculates the down time from a service disruption over set time. Highlights the squad’s ability to detect and resolve issues swiftly. Shorter MoI reflects strong incident response and system resilience.



* _How to measure:_ Measures time it takes for service to recover from failure. Calculated by tracking the average time between a bug report and the moment a bug fix is deployed. 
* _Example: _If your squad had four incidents in a 40-hour workweek and spent one total hour on them (from alert to fix), your MoI for that week would be 15 minutes


# Engineering Metrics (Squad level)


## Branch & PR Age 

Evaluates development best practices on repos.



* _How to measure: _Calculated by the overall average age of branches & pull requests across each repo
* _Example: _Number of commits a branch is behind or ahead of main. Hours or days a PR has existed before merging into main.  


## Code Coverage

Provides percent of unit testing covering the lines of code. Assesses the test performance.



* _How to measure: _3rd party tooling which runs in your automated CI/CD builds
* _Example: _If the code were testing has a 100 lines of code and the number of lines of code that is actually validated in the same software is 50, then the code coverage percentage of this software will be 50%


## Code Quality

Assesses high or low quality of code as well as security related defects. Identifies potential risks of compromising code and indicated where to fix software defects



* _How to measure: _3rd party tooling which runs in your automated CI/CD builds
* _Example: _1 aspect of code quality is reusability. This is best measured by counting the number of interdependencies. The more there are, generally the less reusable the code. 


## Joy Index 

Benchmarks individual developer experience, satisfaction, and happiness.



* _How to measure:_ Employee net promoter score tracks employee engagement and measures the impact of their people and culture initiatives. The eNPS shows how workers feel about your organization. 
* _Example: _Question -_ _“How likely are you to recommend us as a place to work for your family, friends, co-workers?”


# 


# Product Metrics (Product level)


## Business OKRs defined & measurable

OKRs are defined, with clear and inspiring Objectives that align with the company's overall mission and vision. Key Results are specific, measurable, and quantifiable, providing a clear path towards achieving the Objectives. OKRs are regularly reviewed and updated as needed, with a strong commitment to achieving them.



* _How to measure:_ All team members understand the OKRs and how their work contributes to their achievement. The OKRs are logged in the company's OKR tracker. 
* _Example:_ Baggage Services Product; Reduce the percentage in manual edits to optimizer suggested solutions from 86% to 43% by Q3, 23 inorder to increase reliance on the TLink optimizer
