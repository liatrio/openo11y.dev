# Delivery Metrics

Development, QA, Operations, Platform, SRE, Architecture, and every other group
that interacts with a git repository. These teams all participate in delivery.
The following pages describe various metrics that can be used to observe the
effectiveness of delivery teams.

These metrics should be observed as a set; focusing on one metric inherently
diminishes the value of others. Similarly, these metrics should not be the sole
mechanism used for team self-evaluation. Instead, they are a mechanism to provide
qualitative and quantitative
[signals](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md#observability-signals)
to teams that measure their delivery, culture, and joy against an opinionated
set of engineering practices and principles.
