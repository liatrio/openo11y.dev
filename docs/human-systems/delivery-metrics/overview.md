# Engineering Effectiveness and Delivery Metrics

Below defines the approach for measuring engineering teams. The measuring approach will be uniform across engineering delivery. There is no one single metric that rules them all. Focusing on one metric will cause overemphasis in one direction and will negatively impact the others. The outcome is not “big brother is watching” nor is it a way to measure individual performance. Rather, it is a mechanism to provide quantitative and qualitative [signals](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md#observability-signals) to product teams that measure their delivery, culture, and joy against an opinionated set of engineering practices and principles.

Metrics will be gathered real-time or as near real-time as possible. Product delivery will not be impacted if the observability platform is unavailable.
