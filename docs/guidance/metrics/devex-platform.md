# DevEx & Platform Metrics

## Platform Metrics

These metrics serve to provide feedback for shared services teams who exist to serve at the pleasure of product teams. This feedback is critical for providing feedback that platform teams are building the right thing and providing an enjoyable experience to their customers. The high level descriptions are generic in this section given the broad context of “platform”.

- **Adoption Rate** - Assess the adoption rate of your reusable components
- **InnerSourcing Contributions** - Assess the number of code contributions to the platform components from contributors outside of the platform team
- **Platform Experience Survey** - Deploy platform specific questions while users are in the context of using your platform. For example, if your platform is CI/CD, issue a brief survey post git push, while the user is in context, waiting on a build.
- **Platform Hotspots** - Gather component level data from support request intake. Use this data to inform where uplift is needed both in documentation and capability. This will reduce your overall support in the given area and allow the team to stay in context.
- **Platform Resiliency** - Leverage the key tenets of observability to achieve SLI’s and SLO’s specific to your platform. Simply put, this is platform uptime.

## Developer Experience (DevEx) Metrics

These metrics serve to provide the overall experience for engineers at your organization. What does it feel like to work here? These metrics are critical for attracting and retaining talent.

- **Onboarding Experience** - Measure the overall onboarding time from gaining hardware to receiving the proper access to be productive. How does your organization's onboarding experience compare to other organizations?
- **Mean Time 1st Commit In Production** - Calculate the delta between new hire start date to the timestamp of the first commit deployed to Production.
- **Time In Context/Flow** - Measure the amount of time spent doing development work vs in meetings & ceremonies
-**Discoverability of Quality Documentation** - How easy is it to find materials you need to do your job.
Use of Well-Known, “Googleable” Technologies - Using well-known or open source technologies over home-grown, bespoke solutions with high learning curves
