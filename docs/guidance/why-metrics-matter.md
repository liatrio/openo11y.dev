# Why Metrics Matter

Software powers innovation and competitive advantage and metrics have emerged as the compass guiding software delivery teams toward success. They provide a roadmap to accelerated delivery, enhanced quality, and collaborative excellence. By leveraging the insights gleaned from these metrics, organizations can transform their software delivery processes and stay at the forefront of their industries.

## Quantifiable Performance

Metrics provide objective measurements of team performance, fostering a data-driven culture. They enable teams to track progress, set benchmarks, and identify areas for improvement.

## Continuous Improvement

By identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies, metrics enable continuous improvement. Teams can refine processes, optimize workflows, and enhance collaboration to accelerate delivery.

## Risk Mitigation

Certain metrics, such as "change failure rate" and "minutes of impact", measure software stability and reliability. Improving these metrics minimizes business risks associated with service disruptions and costly downtimes.

## Informed Decision-Making

Metrics facilitate informed decision-making by offering a comprehensive view of the software delivery pipeline. Teams can make strategic choices to improve alignment with business goals.

## Cross-Functional Collaboration

Many metrics encourage collaboration between development, operations, and quality assurance teams. Silos are broken down, fostering a holistic approach to software delivery.
