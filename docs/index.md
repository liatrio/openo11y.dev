## What is o11y?

> **o11y** - shorthand for *observability*[^1] which is the ability to measure the
> internal states of a system by examining its outputs[^2].

Observability empowers organizations to easily and effectively observe key data at scale;
Enabling decision making in order to improve the organization's culture, security,
effectiveness, growth, and ultimate success.

> **system** - a group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements
> forming a complex whole

Observability is focused on systems. Systems can be comprised of software, such as a
system of microservices. However, systems can also have other compositions such as people
forming a team, a group of teams, an entire organization, etc.

## Mission

As an [open source project](https://github.com/liatrio/openo11y.dev), OpenO11y's mission
is to enable everyone to observe and improve their systems by offering socio-technical[^3]
guidance, reference architectures (coming soon!), tooling recommendations, and demos.
