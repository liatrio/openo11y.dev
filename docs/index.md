## What is o11y?

> **o11y** - shorthand for *observability*[^1] which is the ability to measure the
> internal states of a system by examining its outputs[^2].

O11y empowers organizations to easily and effectively observe key data at scale; Enabling
decision making in order to improve the organization's culture, security, effectiveness,
growth, and ultimate success.

> **system** - a group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements
> forming a complex whole

Observability is focused on systems. Systems can be comprised of software, such as a
system of microservices. Systems can also be comprised of people, such as a team, a group
of teams, or an entire organization.

## Goals and Methods

As an [open source project](https://github.com/liatrio/openo11y.dev), OpenO11y's goal is
to enable everyone to observe and improve their systems. OpenO11y achieves this goal by
offering technical guidance, social guidance, reference architectures (coming soon!),
tooling recommendations, and demos.
