# Open O11y

---

*To improve, you must observe. Open O11y is one contribution from an internal Technical Advisory Group (TAG) focused on observability at [Liatrio](https://www.liatrio.com/); geared towards this singular north star; enabling observability everywhere*

## What is o11y?

> **o11y** - shorthand for *observability*[^1]  which is the ability to measure the
> internal states of a system by examining its outputs[^2].

O11y empowers organizations to easily and effectively observe key data at scale;
enabling decision making in order to improve company culture, security, effectiveness,
growth, and ultimate business success.

Just as it's important to define what o11y is, it's also important to define a system.

> **system** - a group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements
> forming a complex whole

O11y is focused on systems, and systems can be your microservices, or your people,
your teams, your company and organization.

With that in mind, our goal is to help enable everyone in the industry observe their systems.

## How do we do this?

Here's some things you'll find through Open O11y that help achieve this goal:

- Contributions to Open Source communities focused on O11y
  - For example: [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
- Open-source automations published to get organizations and teams started quickly
  - For example: An observability stack deployable in AWS
  - Guidance on how to use those automations & scale
- Guidance on how to leverage metrics and what to observe related to:
  - team effectiveness
  - joy
  - security

Just like security, o11y is a team sport. We've helped many clients implement
and improve their observability practices, and we want to bring those contributions
to everyone.
