## What is o11y?

> **o11y** - shorthand for *observability*[^1] which is the ability to measure the
> internal states of a system by examining its outputs[^2].

O11y empowers organizations to easily and effectively observe key data at scale;
enabling decision making in order to improve company culture, security, effectiveness,
growth, and ultimate business success.

> **system** - a group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements
> forming a complex whole

O11y is focused on systems. Systems can be comprised of software, such as a system of
microservices. Systems can also be comprised of people, such as a team, a group of
teams, or an entire organization.

## What is OpenO11y?

OpenO11y is an [open source project](https://github.com/liatrio/openo11y.dev/) whose goal
is to enable everyone to observe and improve their systems. OpenO11y achieves this goal
by:

- Participating in open source communities focused on o11y
    - Contributions to [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
    - Leading a [Working Group](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/projects/ci-cd.md)
      to define Semantic Conventions for observing CI/CD pipelines
- Publishing open-source automations and tools to help organizations start observing their
  systems quickly
- Offering guidance here on [OpenO11y](.)
