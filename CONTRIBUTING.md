# Contributing Guide

Your contributions are welcome and encouraged! Thanks for contributing.

## Contribution Scope and Github Issues

Changes that are small in scope may be submitted *without* opening a Github issue. This is
viable when correcting typos or small grammatical errors. It may also be viable when
rewording a sentence or paragraph simply for clarity.

For any other changes, please open a Github issue to propose your changes where they can
be discussed and planned openly. This is appropriate when meaningfully changing or
introducing new content. The content in question could be ideas, recommendations,
diagrams, architectures, tools, etc.

If you are unsure if an issue is needed, please open an issue to discuss your change.

## Commits, Branches, and Pull Requests

All contributions should be committed to a branch and reviewed with a pull request. Forks
certainly may be used but are not required. Commits and pull requests should follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.
